		460 Portfolio 
	</h1>
	<p>
		This is a portfolio for the projects for CS460. It functions as a hub to pages for each homework assignment.
		Each link goes to a seperate page for each of the homeworks. In the future it will also hold
		a page that links to my notes. These notes have not yet been digitized, so that link does not yet exist.
